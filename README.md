**R**

I took [this](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Noise-Complaints/p5f6-bkga/about_data) dataset on 311 noise complaints, [this](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NTA-map/d3qk-pfyz) dataset of NTAs, and [this](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Recreation/Parks-Properties/enfh-gkve/about_data) dataset on parks properties. See comments in R file for details. 

**QGIS**

I did minimal processing in QGIS, just uploaded the geojsons that I wrote with my R code. For the choropleth, I selected graduated symbology by complaints per 1000 people. I used the print layout tool to add a legend and title for the choropleth as well.
